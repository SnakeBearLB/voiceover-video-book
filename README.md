## How it works

> This app is meant to show the capability of editing video client side by utilizing ffmpeg/wasm. 

- user is prompted with 3 pages of a childrens book
- for each page, the user records the audio of them reading the pages out loud.
- the app then finalizes the video by combining the audio with the videos
- the user can then play the video in the browser or download the video
- upon playing:
  - the user will see the video transition to the pages that were presented during the recording process, 
  - the video will pause on the page
  - then the user recorded audio will play for that page
  - when the audio has commenced finished, the next clip will play, transitioning to the next page, then next user audio for that page.
